pclock
======

To use the pClock itself just launch index.html in the build folder. 
We will include source files in dst shortly.

To use the grunt frontend ops and eventually bower for package management you will need to install dependencies.
This includes jslinting, javascript concatenation and minification, and all the wonders grunt has to offer.


Dependencies
============
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)


Installation
============

Install the grunt command line interface
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install the project dependencies
```
npm install
```

then while working, 
```
grunt watch
```
